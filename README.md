# Project 3: RESTful Web API with Node.js Framework

Here we have utilized the "Project 2: Private Blockchain" and expose the functionality as RESTful Web API with Node.js Framework

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Installing Node and NPM is pretty straightforward using the installer package available from the (Node.jsÂ® web site)[https://nodejs.org/en/].

### Frameworks used

hapi[https://www.npmjs.com/package/hapi] framework is used to expose the RESTful Web API.
joi[https://www.npmjs.com/package/joi] is used to validation javascript objects. We use this to validate all the imputs to RESTful Web API.
crypto-js[https://www.npmjs.com/package/crypto-js] is a library for crypto standards. We use this to to generate SHA256 has in this project.
lever[https://www.npmjs.com/package/level] is used to store the blockchain.
bitcoinjs-message[https://www.npmjs.com/package/bitcoinjs-message] is used to verify bitcoin message.

### Configuring your project

- Use NPM to install all the dependencies defined in package.json using the following command. If this step is successful you can skip to next section to test the application.
```
npm install
```
- Use NPM to initialize your project and create package.json to store project dependencies.
```
npm init
```
- Install crypto-js with --save flag to save dependency to our package.json file
```
npm install crypto-js --save
```
- Install level with --save flag
```
npm install level --save
```
- Install hapi with --save flag
```
npm install hapi --save
```
- Install joi with --save flag
```
npm install joi --save
```

## Testing

To test code:
1: Open a command prompt or shell terminal after install node.js.
2: Start node session with server.js.
```
node server.js
```
3: Start Postman
4: Do a GET request to [http://localhost:8000/block/0] to get the genesis block details.
5: Do a POST request to [http://localhost:8000/block] with following. This will create new Block and return the block as JSON
```
{
  "body": "Testing block with test string data"
}
```
6: Do a GET request to [http://localhost:8000/block/{height}] replace the hight with the value returned from previour response and make sure returned value is same as previous one.
7: Do a GET request to [http://localhost:8000/block/{height}] replace the hight any value higher and alpha characters and make sure you are receiving error message.
